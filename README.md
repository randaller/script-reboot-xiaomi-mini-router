# script-reboot-xiaomi-mini-router
Reboot your Xiaomi Mini router (and may be others Xiaomi based on OpenWRT/LUCI) using remote PHP script running on your server/desktop.

Usage:
```
php reboot_router_xiaomi_mini.php
```

Works well under PHP 5 and 7. You need to edit this script first, to set up required variables for your own router.
